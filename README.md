W.T.W-Valentines-Program
========================
At W.T.W. High School, a Valentines Quiz has been issued in previous years to generate revenue for the school.
The Quiz will be taken from Google Apps, and a .xlsx file which contains all of the results can be downloaded.
This program interprets data from the downloaded spreadsheet, and outputs the contents of the spreadsheet.
Eventually, the program will be able to compare the responses of Quiz takers. 

To whoever is reading this: you will not be able to run this code without first downloading Apache.poi and then
completing a complex build path.
